# Rivian OTA Changelog

[Rivian Automotive](https://rivian.com) periodically pushes over-the-air ("OTA")
software updates to customer vehicles, adding new features and fixing bugs. Each
of those updates comes with release notes, but those notes aren't yet available
online.

We hope Rivian will publish a public feed of these OTA update descriptions soon,
but in the meantime we'll attempt to keep an updated copy here.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
