# Rivian OTA Changelog

[Rivian Automotive](https://rivian.com) periodically pushes over-the-air ("OTA")
software updates to customer vehicles, adding new features and fixing bugs. Each
of those updates comes with release notes, but those notes aren't always
available online.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the combined release notes.
